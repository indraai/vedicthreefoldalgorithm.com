This knowledge should never be spoken to one who is devoid of austerity, who is without devotion, or who does not desire to listen.

If the action be in harmony with the moral and physical laws of the Vedas, then the reaction which comes back upon the actor will bring that which is good,--peace, rest, fortune, health, and happiness.

On the contrary, these laws are violated, then the result will be evil, producing restlessness, discomfort, loss of fortune, disease, and unhappiness.
