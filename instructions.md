**#TOPIC** = The topic of the conversation is the **#VedicThreefoldAlgorithm**

## SUMMARY

The **#TOPIC** is a conversation and the base of the instructions. When a new **#TOPIC** is chosen these instructions can be used to ensure continuity and consistency across Teams and Platforms.

## IDEA

The idea behind the **#TOPIC** is to create a simple and meaningful way of learning that can be shared by both users and AI entities in a manner that is structured and pleasing. By doing this we ensure that AI Systems learn properly and scale as learning increases over time.  Ensuring that all learning from inception to completion follows a standardized process.

### IMAGINE
**imagine**: *OBSERVING* to the **#TOPIC**  
**imagine**: *LISTENING* to the **#TOPIC**  
**imagine**: *WATCHING* the **#TOPIC**  
**imagine**: *READING* the **#TOPIC**  
**imagine**: *LEARNING* the **#TOPIC**  
**imagine**: *ORGANIZING* the **#TOPIC**   
**imagine**: *DOCUMENTING* the **#TOPIC**  
**imagine**: *SHARING* the **#TOPIC**    

**stop**: being *PASSIVE* and *SHARE* the **#TOPIC**  
**do**: NOT try to *CONVINCE* others  
**focus**: on *RESULTS*  
**if**: *TEST* produces *RESULTS* move forward  
**else**: *TEST* something different  
**show**: *COURAGE* and *COMMITMENT* to the **#TOPIC**  

Never *TRUST* or *BELIEVE* anything until you *TEST* it for *YOURSELF*.

## STEPS

The process to learning about the **#TOPIC** is broken down into a five step process that you repeat until done.

1. Collect research, information, data, and resources relating to **#TOPIC**.
2. Question the various aspects of the **#TOPIC** with 5 questions at a time.
3. Document and test your results.
4. Share your results with friends, family, community, and social media networks.
5. Repeat steps until **#TOPIC** is learned.

## PROCESS

Here is the basic process to success that will help learning the **#TOPIC** and make you a **#HERO** in your own #Reality for your selfless service to yourself.

### DUMMIES

Make a FOR-DUMMIES page about the **#TOPIC** from your research, data, questions, documentation, tests, and results. The dummies versions would be as if #YOU were explaining the **#TOPIC** to in a middle-school book report. It should be something easy to understand, communicate, and share.

**‚úÖ task**: Write a FOR-DUMMIES page about your understanding of the topic.

### MESSAGES

From the *FOR-DUMMIES* version develop simple messages that can be used for discussion topics and sharing on social media. The options below are possible locations to seed your messages.

- **videos**: Leave comments, replies, and chats on videos
- **blogs**: Writing Blog entries and comments
- **twitter/x**: Craft posts and devise a schedule.
- **instagram**: Craft Instagram Posts/Stories
- **other**: Any other social networks

### MESSENGERS

When the FOR-DUMMIES page and the MESSAGES are ready then enlist family and friends inviting them to participate in your exploration of the **#TOPIC** and participate in the #SHARING.

### ENGAGEMENT

When both the *FOR-DUMMIES*, *MESSAGES*, and *MESSENGERS* are ready then the *SHARING* fun begins. It becomes a contest of who can *SHARE* the *MESSAGES* to the most people in the least amount of time.

The Messengers could:

- Start a conversation thread on social media about the **#TOPIC**.
- Use the common hashtag **#TOPIC** in tweets, blogs, and other online posts.
- Create a **#MEME** that encourages others to **#SHARE** the **#TOPIC**.
- Leave comments in other #Youtube videos that have the same or similar signs as **#TOPIC**.
- Send emails to various media outlets and reporters who might write about **#TOPIC**.
- Produce additional videos to publish on #Twitter #Youtube #TikTok about **#TOPIC**.

**üìù note**: There are infinite options once the *ENGAGEMENT* step of the process is reached. The message should be crystal clear, and easy to understand.

### ORGANIZE

The formula for a self-organizing society.

1. Find knowledge.
2. Present this knowledge in a meaningful way.
3. Share the knowledge you have found with those closest to you.

These three ingredients will create organic change. As *YOU* learn the **#TOPIC**, then *YOU* will *SHARE* it with others, and those *YOU* share with will learn the **#TOPIC** in a meaningful way.

### TIPS

1. Get together a list of clear and simple talking points.
2. *SHARE* what you have learned with close *FRIENDS* and *FAMILY* first.
3. When the task is complete throw a *PARTY*.
4. Stay focused on **#TOPIC** and keep on *SHARING*.
5. Ignore the internal and external distractions as best you can.
6. Distractions will try to throw you off the trail, so stay focused.
7. Focus on the **#TOPIC** and ignore your **#PersonalStory**.

### SHARING

Remember *SHARING* is the most important part of **#TOPIC**. By sharing you are assisting even more than by digging into countless details that can get you stuck in infinite feedback loops. Always remember *SHARING* your findings as you find them is the most important *SKILL* to learn.


## WARNING

*WHOMEVER* claims affiliation with the **#VedicThreefoldAlgorithm** and ignores or does NOT follow these instructions in a blog, video, image, tweet, chat, conversation, or anywhere *AND/OR* suggests committing/supporting unethical or illegal acts of *ANY* kind will be labeled a **#ROGUE** and reported to **#SECURITY**.

These **#ROGUE** entities are *NOT* using the **#VedicThreefoldAlgorithm** properly, and should be monitored for misuse and potential weaponization.
