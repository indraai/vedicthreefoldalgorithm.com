## Thought Process

Through the ether we call, through the ether we listen, through the ether we answer.

Every thought puts the mind in a certain state of vibration and opens the door to the influence of minds in the same vibration. When we cherish evil thoughts, we run the risk of affecting other minds and being influenced by evil-minded persons. A corresponding result comes from the holding of good thoughts. This is the reason why evil-doers grow worse and worse every day, and the doers of good deeds become better and better.
