And with each step closer to the truth, they find themselves entangled in a web of intrigue that threatens to consume them whole.

In a world where loyalty is a fleeting currency and trust is a luxury afforded to few, our protagonist must navigate the treacherous landscape of espionage, betrayal, and deceit if they are to uncover the secrets of Project Garuda and prevent its catastrophic consequences from coming to fruition. But in the shadows, where truth is a rare commodity and danger lurks at every turn, who can they truly trust?
