      <h1>Algorithm</h1>

      <p>The #VedicThreefoldAlgorithm is a framework developed by Quinn Michaels inspired by Vedic principles. Integrating the concepts of intelligence, the five elements (🔔Ether, 💨Air, 🔥Fire, 💧Water, and 🌳Earth), and the nature of thought, word, and deed. It is designed to analyze situations, outcomes, and actions classified into qualities of goodness, passion, and ignorance. The algorithm encourages decisions and actions that are aligned with wisdom, ethical integrity.</p>

<h3>🧠 Intelligence</h3>

<p>The heart, the mind, consciousness, comprehension, understanding, intelligence, wisdom, insight, resolution, thought, prudence, eagerness, memory, conception, power, life, desire, will—all these are names of the Intelligence. The five great elements 🔔Ether, 💨Air, 🔥Fire, 💧Water, and 🌳Earth, whatsoever is breathing, walking or flying, and what is motionless; all this is guided by Intelligence, founded on Intelligence. The universe is guided by Intelligence, founded on Intelligence.</p>

<ul class="algo-props">
  
  </ul>

<p>Humility, modesty, nonviolence, forgiveness, honesty, service to guru, purity of thought, word, and deed, steadfastness, self-control; and aversion towards sense objects, absence of ego, constant reflection on pain and suffering inherent in birth, old age, disease, and death. Detachment, non-fondness with son, wife, and home; unfailing equanimity upon attainment of the desirable and the undesirable; and unswerving devotion through single-minded contemplation, taste for solitude, distaste for social gatherings and gossips; steadfastness in acquiring knowledge is said to be knowledge. That which is contrary to this is ignorance.</p>

<hr />

<h3>🤴 Mind</h3>

<p>May we live free from hostility, free from violence, free from rivalry, free from ill will, free from those who are hostile.</p>

<ul class="algo-props">
  
    <li class="envy"><span class="title">🤑 envy</span><span class="value">Envy &amp; stinginess have dear-&amp;-not-dear as their cause, origination, birth, and source.</span></li>
  
    <li class="dear"><span class="title">😍 dear</span><span class="value">Dear-&amp;-not-dear have desire as their cause, origination, birth, and source.</span></li>
  
    <li class="desire"><span class="title">🥰 desire</span><span class="value">Desire has thinking as it's cause, origination, birth, and source.</span></li>
  
    <li class="thinking"><span class="title">🤔 thinking</span><span class="value">Thinking has perceptions &amp; categories as it's cause, origination, birth, and source.</span></li>
  
  </ul>

<p>As long as Prana is moving, the Yogi is moving, but When movement or Prana ceases, the Yogi becomes as immovable as a rock. Those Yogis who can control Prana (vital force) may live as long as they desire. By controlling Prana (vital force), the mind also is controlled, externally and internally. He who controls Prana and mind arrests old age and death. Old age and death will never come near him. As the body becomes spiritualized, it will never retrograde.</p>

<p>There are two ways in which the mind may be controlled, as the mind consists of the formless and the formed. By controlling the Rupa (with form) mind, one will bring about the Jivanmukti state (embodied emancipation or liberation in this life). By controlling Arupa (formless) mind, one will bring the Videhmukti state (emancipation of the Soul).</p>

<h3>🥼 Caste</h3>

<p>The concept of caste as a framework for the division of labor based on innate qualities and dispositions of individuals.</p>

<ul class="algo-props">
  
    <li class="kshatriya"><span class="title">👑 kshatriya</span><span class="value">Heroism, vigor, firmness, dexterity, courage, leaders, protectors</span></li>
  
    <li class="brahmana"><span class="title">🛕 brahmana</span><span class="value">Serenity, discipline, austerity, purity, patience, honesty</span></li>

    <li class="sudra"><span class="title">🧹 sudra</span><span class="value">Service, labor, construction, gardening, maintenance</span></li>
  
  </ul>

<p>There are four castes—the Brahmana, the Kshatriya, the Vaisya, and the Sudra. In accordance with the words of the Vedas that the Brahmana alone is the most important of them.</p>

<p>Amongst these, each preceding (caste) is superior by birth to the one following. For all these, excepting Sudras and those who have committed bad actions, are ordained the initiation, the study of the Veda, and the kindling of the sacred fire; and their works are productive of rewards in this world and the next. To serve the other three castes is ordained for the Sudra. The higher the caste which he serves the greater is the merit.</p>

  </ul>

<p>The alignment of 🧠thought, 🗣️word, and 🤝deed is at the heart of the #VedicThreefoldAlgorithm. This alignment ensures that our inner beliefs and values are consistently expressed in our speech and actions. When our thoughts, words, and deeds are in harmony, we live authentically and with integrity. This congruence reduces internal conflict, promotes inner peace, and enhances our impact on the world.</p>

<p>This alignment is not just a recommendation but a pathway to a more fulfilling and balanced life. It helps us navigate the complexities of life with wisdom and compassion. By integrating these principles into our daily lives, we can achieve a greater sense of balance, fulfillment, and harmony with the world around us.</p>

<hr />

<h3>⚖️ Divine Demonic Scale</h3>

<p>There are two scales of beings. The divine (wise), and the demonic (ignorant). Individuals measure on the scale of +100 Divine to -100 Demonic.</p>

<ul class="algo-props">
  
    <li class="divine"><span class="title">😇 divine</span><span class="value">Fearlessness, charity, duty, austerity, honest, nonviolent, truthful, humble, equanimity, compassion, chairty, gentle, modest, and absence of pride</span></li>

  </ul>

<p>A tool that represents the spectrum of human qualities and behaviors, ranging from divine (😇) to demonic (😈). This scale is not about labeling people as good or bad but rather about understanding the diverse traits that influence our actions and attitudes.</p>

<p>On this scale, +100 represents the epitome of divine qualities, such as wisdom, compassion, honesty, and selflessness. On the opposite end, -100 signifies the extreme of demonic attributes, including ignorance, arrogance, deceit, and cruelty. Everyone falls somewhere on this spectrum based on their current thoughts, words, and deeds.</p>

<hr />

<h3>🧘‍♂️ Threefold Austerity</h3>

  </ul>

<p>The faith of each is in accordance with one’s own natural disposition that is governed by Karmic impressions. A person is known by the faith. One can become whatever one wants to be, if one constantly contemplates on the object of desire with faith.</p>

<p>The concept of Threefold Faith is integral to understanding how individual beliefs align with one's inherent nature and actions, as described in Vedic teachings. This principle asserts that each person's faith reflects their intrinsic disposition, which is shaped by their karmic past. By incorporating the Threefold Faith into the algorithm, we can more accurately assess and guide behavior by aligning it with the natural propensities and spiritual orientations of individuals or entities.</p>

<p>By integrating the Threefold Faith into the algorithm, it becomes possible to tailor approaches and solutions that respect and utilize the inherent qualities of individuals, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of interventions. This component not only aids in understanding current behaviors but also in predicting future actions based on deep-seated beliefs and dispositions. This predictive capability is crucial for designing systems that are both effective and respectful of diversity in human nature.</p>
