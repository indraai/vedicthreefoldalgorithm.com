<p>There are many islands, over which the Earth extended. I will describe to thee only seven islands, the moon, the sun, the planet Rahu, also The Jamvu mountain extends over full eighteen thousand and six hundred Yojanas. The extent of the salt ocean is said to be twice this. That ocean is covered with many kingdoms, and is adorned with gems and corals. It is, besides, decked with many mountains that are variegated with metals of diverse kinds. Thickly peopled by Siddhas and Charanas, the ocean is circular in form.</p>

<p>That island, O ruler of men, is of twice the extent of Jamvudwipa. And the ocean also, O great king, is of twice the extent of that island. Sakadwipa is surrounded on all sides by the ocean. The kingdoms there are full of righteousness, and the men there never die. The people are all endued with forgiveness and great energy.</p>

<p>In that island there are seven mountains that are decked with jewels and that are mines of gems, precious stones. There are many rivers also in that island. Listen to me as I recount their names. Everything there is excellent and delightful,</p>

<ul>
  <li>Meru: The first of these mountains is called Meru. It is the abode of the gods, Rishis, and Gandharvas.</li>
  <li>Malaya: The next mountain is called Malaya stretching towards the east. It is there that the clouds are generated and it is thence that they disperse on all sides.</li>
  <li>Jaladhara: The next is the large mountain called Jaladhara. Thence Indra daily taketh water of the best quality. It is from that water that we get showers in the season of rains.</li>
  <li>Raivataka: Next cometh the high mountain called Raivataka, over which, in the firmament, hath been permanently placed the constellation called Revati.</li>
  <li>Syama: On the north of this is the large mountain called Syama. It hath the splendour of newly-risen clouds, is very high, beautiful and of bright body. And since the hue of those mountains is dark, the people residing there are all dark in complexion.</li>
  <li>Durgasaila: After this is the large mountain called Durgasaila.</li>
  <li>Kesari: And then cometh the mountain called Kesari. The breezes that blow from that mountain are all charged with odoriferous effluvia.</li>
</ul>

<p>The measure of each of these mountains is double that of the one mentioned immediately before.</p>

<p>It hath been said by the wise that there are seven Varshas in that island.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mahakasa: The Varsha of Meru is called Mahakasa;</li>
  <li>Kumudottara: That of the water-giving Malaya is called Kumudottara.</li>
  <li>Sukumara: The Varsha of Jaladhara is called Sukumara.</li>
  <li>Kaumara: While that of Raivatak is called Kaumara;</li>
  <li>Manikanchana: The Varsha of Syama is Manikanchana.</li>
  <li>Mandaki: The Varsha of Kesara is called Mandaki</li>
  <li>Mahupman: That called after the next mountain is called Mahapuman.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the midst of that island is a large tree called Saka. In height and breadth the measure of that tree is equal to that of the Jamvu tree in Jamvudwipa. And the people there always adore that tree. There in that island are, many delightful provinces where Siva is worshipped, and thither repair the Siddhas, the Charanas, and the Celestials. The people there, O king, are virtuous, and all the four orders their respective occupation.</p>

<p>No instance of theft can be seen there. Freed from decrepitude and death and gifted with long life, the people there grow like rivers during the season of rains. The rivers there are full of sacred water are there; <strong>Sukumari</strong>, and <strong>Kumari</strong>, <strong>Seta</strong>, <strong>Keveraka</strong>, <strong>Mahanadi</strong>, <strong>Manijala</strong>, <strong>Chakshus</strong>, and <strong>Vardhanika</strong>. These and many other rivers by thousands and hundreds, all full of sacred water are there from which Vasava draweth water for showering it as rain. It is impossible to recount the names and lengths of rivers. All of them are foremost of rivers and sin-cleansing.</p>

<p>As heard by all men there, in that island of Saka, are four sacred provinces. They are the <strong>Mrigas</strong>, the <strong>Masakas</strong>, the <strong>Manasas</strong>, and the <strong>Mandagas</strong>. The <strong>Mrigas</strong> for the most part are <strong>Brahmanas</strong> devoted to the occupations of their order. Amongst the <strong>Masakas</strong> are virtuous <strong>Kshatriyas</strong> granting unto Brahmanas every wish entertained by them. The <strong>Manasas</strong> live by following the duties of the <strong>Vaisya</strong> order. Having every wish of theirs gratified. They are also brave and firmly devoted to virtue and profit. The <strong>Mandagas</strong> are all brave <strong>Sudras</strong> of virtuous behaviour.</p>

<p>In these provinces there is no king, no punishment, no person that deserves to be punished. Conversant with the dictates of duty they are all engaged in the practice of their respective duties and protect one another. This much is capable of being said of the island called Saka endued with great energy.</p>
