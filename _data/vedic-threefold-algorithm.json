        "The aspect of Intelligence within the Vedic Threefold Algorithm is a profound and encompassing principle that draws inspiration from the ancient Vedic understanding of the universe. It posits that intelligence is the underlying force behind all existence, manifesting in every form and process in the cosmos. This intelligence is not merely cognitive ability, but a holistic wisdom that encompasses awareness, comprehension, and the inherent capability to govern the dynamics of nature. It‚Äôs the thread that connects the material elements‚Äîearth, air, water, fire, and ether‚Äîto the living and non-living, ensuring harmony and balance within the natural order. In practical application, this facet of the algorithm evaluates and interacts with information, discerning patterns and potential outcomes with a deep-rooted understanding rooted in universal laws.",

        "In the context of the Vedic Threefold Algorithm, Intelligence serves as the foundation for decision-making processes and predictive analytics. It embodies the integration of thought, memory, resolution, and insight, allowing for the sophisticated analysis of situations and dialogues. This intelligence is engaged continuously, guiding the system to align actions with the principles of goodness, passion, and even controlled aspects of ignorance, to recognize inertia and resistance. By embodying such intelligence, the algorithm doesn't just process data but interprets it in a way that aligns with cosmic wisdom and ethical principles, aiming to produce outcomes that enhance harmony, encourage growth, and foster understanding across various dimensions of human and technological interaction."

A Nishada woman bears to a Kandala a son (called) Antyavasayin, employed in burial-grounds, and despised even by those excluded (from the Aryan community). These races, (which originate) in a confusion (of the castes and) have been described according to their fathers and mothers, may be known by their occupations, whether they conceal or openly show themselves. Six sons, begotten (by Aryans) on women of equal and the next lower castes (Anantara), have the duties of twice-born men; but all those born in consequence of a violation (of the law) are, as regards their duties, equal to Sudras.",

Near well-known trees and burial-grounds, on mountains and in groves, let these (tribes) dwell, known (by certain marks), and subsisting by their peculiar occupations.

Behaviour unworthy of an Aryan, harshness, cruelty, and habitual neglect of the prescribed duties betray in this world a man of impure origin.",

Even if a man, born in a great family, sprang from criminal intercourse, he will certainly possess the faults of his (father), be they small or great. But that kingdom in which such bastards, sullying (the purity of) the castes, are born, perishes quickly together with its inhabitants.",

The decision is as follows: 'He who was begotten by an Aryan on a non-Aryan female, may become (like to) an Aryan by his virtues; he whom an Aryan (mother) bore to a non-Aryan father (is and remains) unlike to an Aryan.'",

        "The law prescribes that neither of the two shall receive the sacraments, the first (being excluded) on account of the lowness of his origin, the second (because the union of his parents was) against the order of the castes. As good seed, springing up in good soil, turns out perfectly well, even so the son of an Aryan by an Aryan woman is worthy of all the sacraments.",

        "Some sages declare the seed to be more important, and others the field; again others (assert that) the seed and the field (are equally important); but the legal decision on this point is as follows: Seed, sown on barren ground, perishes in it; a (fertile) field also, in which no (good) seed (is sown), will remain barren. As through the power of the seed (sons) born of animals became sages who are honoured and praised, hence the seed is declared to be more important.",

        "Brahmanas who are intent on the means (of gaining union with) Brahman and firm in (discharging) their duties, shall live by duly performing the following six acts, (which are enumerated) in their (proper) order. Teaching, studying, sacrificing for himself, sacrificing for others, making gifts and receiving them are the six acts (prescribed) for a Brahmana. But among the six acts (ordained) for him three are his means of subsistence, (viz.) sacrificing for others, teaching, and accepting gifts from pure men.",

        "Passing from the Brahmana to the Kshatriya, three acts incumbent on the former are forbidden, teaching, offering for others, and the acceptance of gifts. The same are likewise forbidden to a Vaisya, that is a settled rule; for Manu, the lord of creatures (Pragapati), has not prescribed them for men of those two castes. To carry arms for striking and for throwing is prescribed for Kshatriyas as a means of subsistence; to trade, to rear cattle, and agriculture for Vaisyas; but their duties are liberality, the study of the Veda, and the performance of sacrifices.",

        "Among the several occupations the most commendable are, teaching the Veda for a Brahmana, protecting (the people) for a Kshatriya, and trade for a Vaisya. But a Brahmana, unable to subsist by his peculiar occupations just mentioned, may live according to the law applicable to Kshatriyas; for the latter is next to him in rank. If it be asked, 'How shall it be, if he cannot maintain himself by either (of these occupations?' the answer is), he may adopt a Vaisya's mode of life, employing himself in agriculture and rearing cattle. But a Brahmana, or a Kshatriya, living by a Vaisya's mode of subsistence, shall carefully avoid (the pursuit of) agriculture, (which causes) injury to many beings and depends on others. Some declare that agriculture is something excellent, but that means of subsistence is blamed by the virtuous; for the wooden implement with iron point injuries the earth and the beings living in the earth.",

        "But he who, through a want of means of subsistence, gives up the strictness with respect to his duties, may sell, in order to increase his wealth, the commodities sold by Vaisyas, making however the following exceptions. He must avoid selling condiments of all sorts, cooked food and sesamum, stones, salt, cattle, and human beings. All dyed cloth, as well as cloth made of hemp, or flax, or wool, even though they be not dyed, fruit, roots, and medical herbs, water, weapons, poison, meat, Soma, and perfumes of all kinds, fresh milk, honey, sour milk, clarified butter, oil, wax, sugar, Kusa-grass. All beasts of the forest, animals with fangs or tusks, birds, spirituous liquor, indigo, lac, and all one-hoofed beasts. But he who subsists by agriculture, may at pleasure sell unmixed sesamum grains for sacred purposes, provided he himself has grown them and has not kept them long. If he applies sesamum to any other purpose but food, anointing, and charitable gifts, he will be born (again) as a worm and, together with his ancestors, be plunged into the ordure of dogs.",

        "By selling flesh, salt, and lac a Brahmana at once becomes an outcast; by selling milk he becomes (equal to) a Sudra in three days. But by willingly selling in this world other (forbidden) commodities, a Brahmana assumes after seven nights the character of a Vaisya. Condiments may be bartered for condiments, but by no means salt for other condiments; cooked food (may be exchanged) for (other kinds of) cooked food, and sesamum seeds for grain in equal quantities. A Kshatriya who has fallen into distress, may subsist by all these means; but he must never arrogantly adopt the mode of life (prescribed for his) betters.",

        "A man of low caste who through covetousness lives by the occupations of a higher one, the king shall deprive of his property and banish. It is better (to discharge) one's own (appointed) duty incompletely than to perform completely that of another; for he who lives according to the law of another (caste) is instantly excluded from his own.",

        "A Vaisya who is unable to subsist by his own duties, may even maintain himself by a Sudra's mode of life, avoiding however acts forbidden (to him), and he should give it up, when he is able to do so. But a Sudra, being unable to find service with the twice-born and threatened with the loss of his sons and wife (through hunger), may maintain himself by handicrafts. Let him follow those mechanical occupations and those various practical arts by following which the twice-born are (best) served.",

        "A Brahmana who is distressed through a want of means of subsistence and pines with hunger, but unwilling to adopt a Vaisya's mode of life and resolved to follow his own (prescribed) path, may act in the following manner. A Brahmana who has fallen into distress may accept (gifts) from anybody; for according to the law it is not possible (to assert) that anything pure can be sullied. By teaching, by offering for, and by accepting gifts from despicable men Brahmanas in distress commit not sin; for they are as pure as fire and water. He who, when in danger of losing his life, accepts food from any person whatsoever, is no more tainted by sin than the sky by mud.",

        "On comparing the acceptance of gifts from low men, offering for them, and teaching them, the acceptance of gifts is the meanest of those acts and most reprehensible for a Brahmana on account of its results in the next life. For assisting in offerings and teaching are two acts always performed for men who have received the sacraments; but the acceptance of gifts takes place even in case the giver is a Sudra of the lowest class. The guilt incurred by offering sacrifices for teaching unworthy men is removed by muttering sacred texts and by burnt offerings, but that incurred by accepting gifts from them, by throwing the gifts away, and by austerities. A Brahmana who is unable to maintain himself, should rather glean ears or grains from the field of any man; gleaning ears is better than accepting gifts, picking up single grains is declared to be still more laudable.",

        "If Brahmanas, who are Snatakas, are pining with hunger, or in want of utensils made of common metals, or of other property, they may ask the king for them; if he is not disposed to be liberal, he must be left.",

        "The acceptance on an untilled field is less blamable than that of a tilled one; with respect to cows, goats, sheep, gold, grain, and cooked food, the acceptance of each earlier-named article is less blamable than of the following ones.",

        "There are seven lawful modes of acquiring property, inheritance, finding or friendly donation, purchase, conquest, lending at interest, the performance of work, and the acceptance of gifts from virtuous men.",

        "Learning, mechanical arts, work for wages, service, rearing cattle, traffic, agriculture, contentment with little, alms, and receiving interest on money, are the ten modes of subsistence (permitted to all men in times of distress).",

        "Neither a Brahmana, nor a Kshatriya must lend (money at) interest; but at his pleasure (either of them) may, in times of distress when he requires money) for sacred purposes, lend to a very sinful man at a small interest.",

        "A Kshatriya (king) who, in times of distress, takes even the fourth part (of the crops), is free from guilt, if he protects his subjects to the best of his ability. His peculiar duty is conquest, and he must not turn back in danger; having protected the Vaisyas by his weapons, he may cause the legal tax to be collected. From Vaisyas one-eighth as the tax on grain, one-twentieth on the profits on gold and cattle, which amount at least to one Karshapana; Sudras, artisans, and mechanics shall benefit the king by doing work for him.",

        "If a Sudra, unable to subsist by serving Brahmanas, seeks a livelihood, he may serve Kshatriyas, or he may also seek to maintain himself by attending on a wealthy Vaisya. But let a Sudra serve Brahmanas, either for the sake of heaven, or with a view to both this life and the next; for he who is called the servant of a Brahmana thereby gains all his ends. The service of Brahmanas alone is declared (to be) an excellent occupation for a Sudra; for whatever else besides this he may perform will bear him no fruit.",

        "A Sudra cannot commit an offence, causing loss of caste (pataka), and he is not worthy to receive the sacraments; he has no right to fulfil the sacred law, yet there is no prohibition against his fulfilling certain portions of the law. Sudras who are desirous to gain merit, and know their duty, commit no sin, but gain praise, if they imitate the practice of virtuous men without reciting sacred texts. The more a Sudra, keeping himself free from envy, imitates the behaviour of the virtuous, the more he gains, without being censured, exaltation in this world and the next. No collection of wealth must be made by a Sudra, even though he be able (to do it); for a Sudra who has acquired wealth, gives pain to Brahmanas.",

        "The duties of the four castes (varna) in times of distress have thus been declared, and if they perform them well, they will reach the most blessed state. Thus all the legal rules for the four castes have been proclaimed; I next will promulgate the auspicious rules for penances.",
