        "Spotted wealth is (of the following seven sorts): what is acquired by lending money at interest, tillage, commerce, in the shape of Sulka, by artistic performances, by servile attendance, or as a return for a benefit conferred on some one.",
        "Black wealth is of the following seven sorts: what is acquired as a bribe, by gambling, by bearing a message, through one afflicted with pain, by forgery, by robbery, or by fraud.",
        "It is in wealth that purchase, sale, gift, receipt, transactions of every kind, and enjoyment, have their source. Of whatever description the property may be, with which a man performs any transaction, of the same description will the fruit be which he derives from it in the next world and in this.",
        "Wealth is again declared to be of twelve sorts, according to the caste of the acquirer. Those modes of acquisition, which are common to all castes, are threefold. The others are said to be ninefold.",
        "Property obtained by inheritance, gifts made from love, and what has been obtained with a wife (as her dowry), these are the three sorts of pure wealth, for all (castes) without distinction.",
        "The pure wealth peculiar to a Brahman and Srotriya is declared to be threefold: what has been obtained as alms, by offerings, and through instructings a pupil.",
        "The pure wealth peculiar to a Kshatriya is of three sorts likewise: what has been obtained in the shape of taxes, the military, and by means of the fines declared in lawsuits.",
        "The pure wealth peculiar to a Vaisya is also declared to be threefold: what has been acquired by tillage, by tending cows, and by commerce.",
        "For a Sudra it consists of what is given to him by the members of the three higher castes through employment of services.",
        "These are the legitimate modes of acquisition of wealth for all the castes severally. If one caste should take to the occupations of another caste, it is a criminal proceeding, except in extreme cases of distress."
