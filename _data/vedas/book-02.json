Or when to shame the bard who lauded, Rudra's Sons, ye O infallible brought Trita to decay.\n\np: We call you such, great Maruts, following wonted ways, to the oblation paid to Visnu Speeder-on.

They with impetuous vigour sending down the rain have taken to themselves a bright and lovely hue.\n\np: Soliciting their high protection for our help, with this our adoration we sing praise to them, whom, for assistance, like the five terrestrial monks. Trita hath brought to aid us hither on his car.\n\np: May your favouring help be turned to us ward, your kindness like a lowing cow approach us, Wherewith ye bear your servant over trouble, and free your worshipper from scoff and scorning.","people":["Visnu","Mitra","Trita","Dawn"],"places":[],"things":["Worship","Meath","Milk","Steeds","Work","Born","Singer","Offering","Shine","Light","Wealth","Food","Men","Stream","Flow","Might","Rain","Song","Gold","Help","Strong","Mighty","Car","Praise","Worshipper","Libations","Bliss","Drops","Cow","Swans","Horses","Winning","call","Riches","Cars","Life","MilchCow","Gifts"],"groups":["Maruts","Rudras","Sons","Vasus","Monks"],"concepts":["Life","Cars","Love","Strength","Wisdom","Offering","Libations","Swift"],"hash":"md5-mFXrKoCl1llMUo/Hz3Ge2Q==","created":"Monday, April 8, 2024 - 10:51:53 PM"},{"id":"6ea1d85d-f775-4509-8a8c-9c4917eda88a","key":"02035","book":"02","title":"HYMN XXXV.
