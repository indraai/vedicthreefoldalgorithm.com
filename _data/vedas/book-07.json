May your wrathful might prevail and conquer them.\n\np: Indra and Soma, hurl your deadly crushing bolt down on the wicked fiend from heaven and from the earth. Yea, forge out of the mountains your celestial dart wherewith ye burn to death the waxing demon race.\n\np: Indra and Soma, cast ye downward out of heaven your deadly darts of stone burning with fiery flame, Eternal, scorching darts; plunge the voracious ones within the depth, and let them sink without a sound.\n\np: Indra and Soma, let this hymn control you both, even as the girth encompasses two vigorous steeds- The song of praise which I with wisdom offer you: do ye, as Lords of men, animate these my meditations.\n\np: In your impetuous manner think ye both thereon: destroy these evil beings, subdue the treacherous fiends.
