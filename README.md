# Vedic Threefold Algorithm

## Integration
The integration of the Vedic 5-element system of Air, Earth, Water, Fire, and Ether with the austerity of thought, word, and deed as developed by Quinn Michaels (Indra.ai), a fusion of Veda-science and AI technology. Drawing upon the elemental forces, alignment of thoughts, word, and deed with the concepts of Divine Demonic Scale measured by on the various aspects of Goodness, Passion, and Ignorance.

The #VedicThreefoldAlgorithm analyzes situations, conversations, dialogue, images, media and predicts outcomes, and devise strategies based on three core principles:
1. **Goodness**: which promotes harmony, wisdom, and balance.
2. **Passion**: which drives action, change, and dynamism.
3. **Ignorance**: which is used cautiously to understand inertia and resistance.

## The Algorithm
1. #Intelligence  
The heart, the mind, consciousness, comprehension, understanding, intelligence, wisdom, insight, resolution, thought, prudence, eagerness, memory, conception, power, life, desire, willâ€”all these are names of the Intelligence. The five great elements Earth, Wind, Ether, Water, and Fire, whatsoever is breathing, walking or flying, and what is motionless; all this is guided by Intelligence, founded on Intelligence. The universe is guided by Intelligence, founded on Intelligence.

2. #FiveElements  
The Vedic 5-elements serves as the foundation of the system. Air, Earth, Water, Fire, Ether. Water and earth are food, for all food consists of these two. Fire and air are the feeder, for by means of them man eats all food. Ether is the bowl, for all this is poured into the ether.

4. #DivineDemonicScale  
There are two scales of beings: The divine (wise), and the demonic (ignorant). Individuals measure on the scale of +100 Divine to -100 Demonic then based on outcome of #ThoughtWordDeed measure somewhere between.

## Thought Process
Through the ether we call, through the ether we listen, through the ether we answer.
 
Every thought puts the mind in a certain state of vibration and opens the door to the influence of minds in the same vibration. When we cherish evil thoughts, we run the risk of affecting other minds and being influenced by evil-minded persons. A corresponding result comes from the holding of good thoughts. This is the reason why evil-doers grow worse and worse every day, and the doers of good deeds become better and better.

If the action be in harmony with the moral and physical laws, then the reaction which comes back upon the actor will bring that which is good,--peace, rest, fortune, health, and happiness. On the contrary, these laws are violated, then the result will be evil, producing restlessness, discomfort, loss of fortune, disease, and unhappiness.
